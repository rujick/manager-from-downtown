# Deconstruction

While browsing through posts on Facebook; she notices a comment by Richard Hamm, which reads:

"It shouldn't be my responsibility to teach; I had to learn things on my own. If you can't find the motivation to be who you want to be, or can't even find something that sparks that interest in you, then this is your fault, and I should not have to pay for your own shortcomings."

The comment was very interesting to her. She checks the post, which is by someone she is unfamiliar with, Hossam Ali.

"Our 67-year-old security guard, Mahmoud Naguib, passed away yesterday due to a heart attack.

He may not have been the most pleasant person to work with, but he did his job as well as it could be.
And he did this job for 48 years.

48 years of being a security guard.

I spoke with a few people in our cafeteria who knew him. He is survived by three children, and three grand-children. His wife will be cared for by his eldest son.

Yet he worked for 48 years as a security guard.

I spent a few months working as a security guard at a mall. The job was not bad, especially for me, since it gave me proper time to study; but it during working hours, it is just a lot of wandering around, making sure things are secure.

I always thought that the future prospects of this job would be something like being a senior security guard, a supervisor, a senior supervisor, security manager, etc.

But not for our Mahmoud Naguib, it wasn't. He worked 48 years as a security guard. Change in pay reflected the rise and fall of prices, but nothing more. His experience as a security guard accounted for nothing.

I started wandering about young Mahmoud Naguib, before he became a security guards, or at least early in his employment. Did he at some point want to become a doctor? an engineer? a police officer? a pilot? Did he at some point want to have a job that gives him any sort of fulfillment; even if a little bit?

What was Mahmoud Naguib's dream?

In my company, we have three hundred employees, working in different jobs; software development, financial analysts, lawyers, software testers, strategic planners, media experts. Many different jobs.

Also in my company, we have around 20 workers; security guards, cleaners, cafeteria
