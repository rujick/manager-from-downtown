=============

This arc deals with the manager's finding out about the Idea, and her attempts at implementing it in her workplaces.

# Summary

A manager at a top company in London finds out about an initiative, done by a financial analyst living in Lincolnshire. She tries to do the initiative at her company; but her company grows suspicious, and subsequently, she is fired.

She spends the next few months looking for a job, and decides to look up the financial analyst, and applying at his company. She gets the job, amidst concerns from a senior manager, whom she dubs the unfriendly manager. She meets with the financial analyst, and speaks with him secretly about his initiative. He shows doubt about his idea, but she reminds him with his own comments about how much good can this initative do to people. He thinks this through, and finally he agrees to participate.

The next day, they shake hands.

## Discovering the Idea

The manager is browsing through posts, and finds a post commented on by one of her friends, which peaks her interest. She finds the topic of the post very interesting. She reads through the comments on the post, and she is amazed at the ideas mentioned in the post.

## First Try

The manager speaks with one of the pantry people, and their conversation goes to what the pantry worker hopes to be; he speaks about being a finances man. She thinks about that for a few days, and decides to help them. She gathers a few of the pantry workers who actually wanted to learn the craft, and decides to give them each day one hour of financial education. When it proves to be too much, she enlists the help of her coworkers. The pantry company hears about this, and calls senior management who tries to stop the manager. Things escalate, and she is forced out of the company the next year.

## Job Application

After she is forced out of the company, she learns that three pantry staff have been fired as well. She tries to help them, but they refuse her help; one of them (her friend from 2) decides not to talk to her again. She tries to find charities that can help in this regard; she finds a few, but feels that they do not provide any meaningful benefit. She talks with the organizers who also let her go. At that point, she starts looking for jobs, and decides to go to the company where the financial analyst works. She applies.

## Meeting the Brains

She does a couple of interviews, which she passes easily; then she does another couple of interviews with managers, one of them goes terribly, but the other one is impressed. She meets the Brains behind the Idea for the first time; they shake hands, and she promises that they will meet again. Two weeks later, she has a high senior manager calls her for another last interview, after which she passes.

## First Contact

Once she settles in the company, she goes to the Brains, and she tells him that she intends to implement his vision of the Idea, but she wants to be very careful this time, and involve senior management as soon as possible. She tells him about her attempt in her older company, and how badly it went. He feels guilty about the lives that were destroyed indirectly by him, and he says that this is a very dangerous thing to do, and it is better not to stir them, even though the idea should be implemented. A week later, he has a conversation with his wife, who encourages him to pursue this goal. He calls the manager the next day, and tells her that he is up for it.
